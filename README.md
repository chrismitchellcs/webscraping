# webscraping

Hello!

This is a python webscraping web application used to browse any and all craigslist pages at the same time!  

At times I found I would be looking for a product that is very rare and that I may not be able to get locally.  With this application you can select however many cities to search through, and find the product you are after in any city.  It is still in beta and only works on searches that are one word.  I will update that soon.  

It uses python for the backend with Flask and HTML to display the webpage.  If you test it out it can be really slow with some queries as it loads each individual image.
